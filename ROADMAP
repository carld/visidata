# Feature Roadmap

A loose plan that is subject to change.

  - mass rename with transform
  - ^Delete
  - only apply changes with ^S
- checkpoint data for faster replay/undo
- connect to larger datasets (via blaze?)
- load new .py plugins for inputs/outputs/sheets
   - git app that can streamline standard workflows
     - checkout branch or revision with TUI interface
     - browse through history
- load larger than memory .csv/tsv files
- fixed-column detector
- '.' repeat command
- save all sheets to .h5 file
- reload derived sheets
- html table parsing into columns
