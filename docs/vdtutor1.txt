# If you get scared or stuck,	try these keys:
	
To drop the current sheet	q
To abort a command expecting input	Ctrl-c
To exit the program immediately	Ctrl-q
To see the last error	Ctrl-e
	
# So let's get started with	some basic concepts:
	
All screens in VisiData are	sheets
Sheets have	rows and columns
Inside VisiData, there are	no cells
Any apparent cell is	just one row as viewed by one column
This is the zen of VisiData.
	
# To move the cursor	press these keys:
	
Left Down Up Right	h j k l
PageUp PageDown	Ctrl-b Ctrl-f
	
The row cursor is highlighted in	reverse
The column cursor is highlighted in	bold
[Display theme elements can be set in	the 'O'ptions Sheet]
	
# Many commands can be modified with	the 'g' prefix
With movement commands, the cursor	goes all the way in that direction
